# Phase 2 Business Release Narrative

## Overview

Phase 2 delivers the "Core Functionality Enhancement" milestone for the Universal Reconciliation Platform. The release unlocks
the configurability, workflow discipline, and transparency required to move beyond a pilot and into broader production use.
Operational teams can now model nuanced matching logic, restrict data by business dimensions, enforce maker-checker controls, and
monitor end-to-end activity without bespoke code changes.

## What Changed for Stakeholders

### Operations & Reconciliation Analysts
- Configure reconciliation definitions with granular field metadata (numeric thresholds, case-insensitive text, date-only
  comparisons) so the matching engine reflects real-world tolerances.
- Analyse break inventories using dynamic filters for Product, Sub-Product, Entity, and Break Status to focus on the most relevant
  workload.
- Capture detailed investigation notes while the system records a complete audit trail of status changes and comments.

### Control Office & Risk
- Enforce maker-checker duties by assigning LDAP security groups to Maker, Checker, or Viewer roles per reconciliation scope. Makers
  can only submit items for approval, while Checkers control the final sign-off.
- View a consolidated system activity feed highlighting reconciliation runs and workflow actions for oversight and assurance.

### Technology & Platform Administrators
- Model new reconciliations via metadata alone—the matching engine reads configuration and requires no code deployment.
- Rely on LDAP as the single source of authorization, reducing the need to manage reconciliation-specific users or local roles.
- Benefit from structured documentation and automated tests (Jacoco-enforced) to simplify governance and future change reviews.

## Key Business Capabilities Delivered

1. **Configurable Matching Engine** – Numeric tolerance, case-insensitive comparison, and date-only logic are selectable per field.
2. **Dimensional Access Control** – Access is scoped by Product/Sub-Product/Entity with Maker/Checker/Viewer roles derived from LDAP.
3. **Maker-Checker Workflow** – Status transitions respect the configured workflow, supporting submissions, approvals, and rework.
4. **Dynamic Dashboard Filtering** – Users can slice break inventories by business dimensions and workflow state directly in the UI.
5. **System Activity Timeline** – A dedicated activity feed surfaces recent runs, status changes, and commentary for audit readiness.

## Rollout Considerations

- **Training** – Provide quick-reference guides for configuring comparison rules and interpreting the new dashboard filters.
- **Access Provisioning** – Coordinate with IAM teams to align LDAP group memberships with Maker/Checker responsibilities.
- **Data Migration** – Review existing reconciliations to set appropriate threshold values and product/entity metadata before go-live.
- **Support Readiness** – Update runbooks with instructions for reviewing the activity feed and troubleshooting maker-checker issues.

Phase 2 positions the platform for scale by codifying the controls and configurability expected in production reconciliations while
maintaining the "configuration over code" promise from the original vision.
