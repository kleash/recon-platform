# Phase 1 Business Overview

## Objective
Deliver an end-to-end reconciliation capability that demonstrates the platform vision with a single reconciliation, LDAP-backed security, a basic analyst user experience, and auditable break management.

## Delivered Value Streams

### 1. Reconciliation Lifecycle
* **Configuration-first delivery** – Cash vs General Ledger reconciliation defined entirely through metadata and seeded data. No bespoke code changes are needed to introduce the reconciliation beyond the generic engine.
* **Automated execution** – Operations teams can manually trigger the matching engine via UI or API, obtaining matched, mismatched, and missing counts.
* **Excel export** – Analysts can extract the latest run into Excel for ad hoc analysis, providing immediate parity with existing spreadsheet-driven processes.

### 2. Security & Compliance
* **Enterprise authentication** – Embedded LDAP demonstrates integration with enterprise directories while keeping the JWT limited to session propagation. Group membership fully determines what a user can see and touch.
* **Access governance** – Access control entries tie LDAP groups to reconciliations and permission scopes, ensuring non-authorised staff cannot view or alter break data.
* **Auditability** – Every analyst action (comment or status update) is journaled with the user’s LDAP DN and timestamp, satisfying audit requirements from day one.

### 3. Analyst Experience
* **Targeted dashboard** – Users see only their authorised reconciliations, the most recent run summary, and a live break inventory.
* **Structured investigations** – Side-by-side source views highlight data differences. Analysts can log investigation notes, capture reason codes, and manage break statuses (Open, Pending Approval, Closed).
* **Fast adoption** – Opinionated UI layout, default LDAP credentials, and seeded sample data allow operations SMEs to experience the workflow immediately.

## Out-of-Scope (Deferred to Later Phases)
* Threshold-based, fuzzy, or date-tolerant matching logic.
* Maker-checker approval routing.
* Dynamic dashboard filtering by product/entity dimensions.
* Kafka/API-triggered execution and comprehensive activity logging.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. **Expand matching configurability** – Introduce comparison logic metadata to support tolerances and date handling.
2. **Harden security model** – Integrate with enterprise LDAP, externalise configuration, and map full access control matrix dimensions.
3. **Enhance workflow** – Add maker-checker queues, bulk updates, and richer audit trail review.
4. **Stabilise deployment** – Containerise services, create CI/CD pipelines, and wire automated smoke tests across backend and frontend.
