- **Source schema refactor (2025-10-03)**
  - Reordered the admin configurator wizard so raw source schema capture precedes transformations and matching.
  - Persisted per-source schema metadata and introduced automated inference from sample files.
  - Simplified canonical schema maintenance by removing redundant transformation controls from the legacy schema step.
- **Global multi-asset showcase (2025-10-04)**
  - Added the Excel ingestion adapter and corresponding automation fixtures to reconcile six heterogeneous sources.
  - Authored the Global Multi-Asset playbook with diagrams covering business flow, technical hotspots, and usage.
  - Updated the integration harness and ingestion SDK so Excel, CSV, and pipe-delimited feeds can be rehearsed in CI.
- **Angular 20 platform upgrade (2025-10-04)**
  - Stepped the frontend through Angular 18 → 19 → 20 with TypeScript 5.8.2 and Node 20.19.5.
  - Accepted CLI migrations for bundler module resolution and standalone-by-default components, trimming unused pipes to quell new compiler warnings.
  - Executed the full quality gate suite (backend unit tests, Karma, Playwright, integration harness, bootstrap, historical seed) to confirm parity post-upgrade.
