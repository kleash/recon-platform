### 3.2 Architectural Layers
- **Client Experience (Angular SPA):** Delivers responsive dashboards, break management consoles, and configuration studios with stateful session handling and drill-down analytics.
- **Application Services (Spring Boot):** Encapsulate reconciliation orchestration, matching passes, workflow state management, export generation, and API surfaces.
- **Data Layer:** MariaDB (production) or H2 (development) stores reconciliation definitions, run outcomes, break inventories, and audit trails.
- **Identity & Security:** LDAP-backed authentication, JWT issuance/validation, and scope-based authorization ensure least-privilege access.
- **Integration Surface:** Metadata-driven ETL runners, REST APIs, Kafka hooks, and scheduled tasks support upstream data ingestion and downstream automation.

### 3.3 Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Configuration over code:** Every reconciliation definition, field mapping, tolerance, and report layout resides in metadata tables to minimize deployments for business change.
- **Hexagonal boundaries:** Controllers adapt protocols; services remain domain-centric and easily testable.
- **Observability:** Structured activity events, correlation IDs, and Spring Actuator metrics enable runtime diagnostics.
- **Resilience:** Stateless API pods scale horizontally; database replicas support read-heavy analytics; ETL pipelines are idempotent and restartable.

## 4. Platform Differentiators & Advantages
- **Rapid onboarding:** Cloneable configuration templates and sample ETL pipelines compress time-to-value for new reconciliations.
- **End-to-end governance:** Maker/checker, audit logs, and role-based data masking satisfy regulatory oversight requirements.
- **Unified analyst workspace:** Real-time KPI dashboards, filterable break grids, and contextual comparisons accelerate investigation.
- **Automation-ready:** REST and event-driven hooks allow schedulers, RPA, or microservices to trigger runs or consume results programmatically.
- **Operational transparency:** System activity feed, health endpoints, and metrics underpin proactive support and compliance attestations.

## 5. Feature Highlights
| Domain | Representative Capabilities | Business Benefit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Configuration Studio** | Dynamic schema builder, reusable templates, environment promotion. | Scale reconciliations without developer cycles. |
| **Matching & Analytics** | Multi-stage rule execution, tolerance-aware comparisons, run analytics & charts. | Boost matching accuracy and visibility. |
| **Workflow & Case Management** | Automated break creation, maker-checker approvals, bulk updates, audit immutability. | Reduce manual handoffs and enforce controls. |
| **Reporting & Distribution** | Excel template engine, on-demand & scheduled exports, compliance archives. | Deliver consumable outputs to stakeholders. |
| **Security & Compliance** | LDAP/JWT identity, scope-based entitlements, configurable data masking. | Align with enterprise security policies. |
| **Operations & Observability** | Health monitoring, self-healing ETL, diagnostics toolset. | Simplify support and incident response. |

### 5.1 Operations & Observability Capabilities Explained
- **Health monitoring:** Spring Boot Actuator endpoints, synthetic run probes, and Grafana-style dashboards provide real-time visibility into API availability, match throughput, queue depths, and user experience indicators. Alerting hooks route anomalies to on-call rotations before analysts feel the impact.
- **Self-healing ETL:** Metadata-driven pipelines checkpoint each stage, replay failed batches automatically, and leverage idempotent writes so that reruns do not duplicate breaks. Built-in retry policies and circuit breakers keep ingestion resilient to upstream delays or malformed files.
- **Diagnostics toolset:** Structured activity feeds, correlation IDs spanning UI → API → ETL, and targeted data sampling scripts give support teams the context needed for root-cause analysis. Run timelines, diff viewers, and export rehydration utilities accelerate break investigations.

## 6. Deployment & Operations Blueprint
- **Topology:** SPA assets via CDN/edge, Spring Boot pods behind internal load balancer, MariaDB primary with optional read replicas, LDAP integration over secure channels.
- **Environments:** Dev (H2 + demo data), local MariaDB, QA/UAT, Production with hardened profiles.
- **CI/CD Flow:** Git commit → CI pipeline (backend + frontend builds) → automated tests & static checks → deploy to Dev → smoke tests → promote to QA/Prod.
- **Security Controls:** TLS termination at WAF/LB, JWT expiration & refresh policies, audit trails for config changes, optional data masking in UI/export layers.
- **SRE Tooling:** Actuator endpoints, structured logs, activity feed streaming to SIEM/observability stack, database backups & point-in-time recovery.
