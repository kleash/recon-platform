# Admin Configurator Components

## Wizard Flow

- **Source Schema step** sits between Sources and Transformations. Administrators can upload a sample file or add
  fields manually to define the raw schema for each source.
- **Transformations** reuse the declared schema to surface column dropdowns and preview data consistently across the
  wizard.
- **Matching rules** draw from the schema-driven column catalogue, eliminating the need to maintain duplicate mappings
  in multiple steps.

## Backend Services

- `AdminSourceSchemaService` reuses the transformation sample parser to infer field names, data types, and sample rows
  from uploaded files.
- `AdminReconciliationService` now persists `schemaFields` on each source. The stored schema is surfaced in
  `AdminSourceDto` and exported through the reconciliation schema endpoint for downstream consumers.

## Ingestion Adapters

- `ExcelIngestionAdapter` extends the ingestion surface to multi-sheet workbooks. It honours the same parsing options as
  the preview service (`hasHeader`, `includeAllSheets`, `sheetNameColumn`, `skipRows`) so admins can configure and ingest
  Excel sources without re-uploading CSV conversions.
- Harness scenario **GLOBAL_MULTI_ASSET_COMPLEX** uses the Excel adapter alongside CSV and pipe-delimited feeds to prove
  cross-format parity. Adapter options are supplied through automation metadata to tag the originating worksheet for each
  record, and each source now ships with dataset Groovy scripts, row filters, and column pipelines so analysts can see
  concrete examples of normalization, filtering, and enrichment across formats.

## Frontend Shell (Angular 20)

- All UI components remain standalone but no longer need the explicit `standalone: true` flag after the Angular 19+ migration.
  Keep the `imports` arrays minimal and remove unused Angular pipes (`JsonPipe`, `AsyncPipe`, etc.) to avoid compiler warnings.
- `tsconfig.json` now leverages `moduleResolution: "bundler"`; reuse the workspace config when adding tooling or storybook
  builds so imports resolve consistently across unit tests, Playwright specs, and prod builds.
- Karma tests continue to run via `ChromeHeadlessNoSandbox`; the npm script stays `ng test --watch=false --browsers=ChromeHeadlessNoSandbox`.
- `AnalystWorkspaceComponent` owns the tab orchestration and filter propagation. Observables exposed from
  `ReconciliationStateService` and `ResultGridStateService` now carry inline documentation describing their lifecyclesâ€”reference the source to understand how break reselection and bulk-update locking works before extending the workspace.
