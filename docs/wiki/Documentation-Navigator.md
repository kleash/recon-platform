# Documentation Navigator

Use this index to quickly locate the right guide for your task. Each entry lists the primary audience, when to use it, and the key
takeaways. If a page moves or is replaced, update this navigator and the [wiki home](./README.md) accordingly.

## Platform Orientation
- **[Getting Started](./Getting-Started.md)** — *Audience: new engineers.* Local environment bootstrap, stack layout, and smoke tests.
- **[Architecture](./Architecture.md)** — *Audience: architects, senior engineers.* End-to-end topology, data flow, and integration seams.
- **[Architecture Review Briefing](./Architecture-Review-Briefing.md)** — *Audience: stakeholders.* Slide-style snapshot used for steering committees and roadmap briefings.

## Analyst Workspace & Operations
- **[features.md](./features.md)** — *Audience: product owners, sales engineering.* Canonical source of released capabilities (dashboards, saved views, maker-checker, exports).
- **[API Reference](./API-Reference.md)** — *Audience: integrators, automation engineers.* REST endpoint catalogue including break search parameters, export jobs, and admin tooling.
- **[Documentation Navigator](./Documentation-Navigator.md)** — *Audience: everyone.* You are here—bookmark for quick discovery.
- **[Tutorial: Creating a New Reconciliation](./Tutorial-Creating-a-New-Reconciliation.md)** — *Audience: analysts, developers.* Hands-on walk-through that exercises admin APIs, ingestion endpoints, and analyst review flows.

## Configuration & Governance
- **[Admin Configurator Guide](./Admin-Configurator-Guide.md)** — *Audience: reconciliation administrators.* Metadata-driven authoring, canonical fields, and deployment best practices.
- **[Onboarding Playbook](./onboarding-guide.md)** — *Audience: project leads, operations managers.* Governance checklist, sample payloads, and post-go-live monitoring guidance.
- **[Database Schema Reference](./Database-Schema.md)** — *Audience: database administrators, reporting teams.* Latest entity definitions spanning configuration, ingestion, runs, workflow audit, and exports.
- **[Development Workflow](./Development-Workflow.md)** — *Audience: contributors.* Build commands, automated test suites, debugging tips, and lint conventions.

## Quality & Automation
- **[Automation Regression Guide](../../automation/regression/README.md)** — *Audience: QA, release engineering.* Playwright smoke suite, evidence capture, and extending coverage.
- **[Examples Integration Harness](../../examples/integration-harness/README.md)** — *Audience: integration testers.* Spin up multi-scenario reconciliations and drive ingestion via the CLI.
- **[Global Multi-Asset Playbook](./Global-Multi-Asset.md)** — *Audience: solution architects.* Business case, configuration steps, and diagrams for the six-source showcase reconciliation.

## Historical Context & Completed Work
- **[Completed Feature Specifications](./completed-features/README.md)** — Archive of shipped feature briefs, including the frontend enhancement request now marked as delivered.
- **[Bootstrap Charter](../Bootstrap.md)** — Foundational charter and phased rollout plan that informed the initial build.

> Tip: When adding new guides, keep the headings consistent (Orientation, Analyst Workspace, Configuration, Quality, Historical)
> so the navigator remains scannable for stakeholders.
