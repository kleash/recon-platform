# AI & LLM Enhancement Blueprint

## Purpose
This document outlines opportunities to extend the Universal Reconciliation Platform with artificial intelligence and large language model (LLM) capabilities. It builds on the existing metadata-driven reconciliation engine, workflow tooling, and analytics surfaces to deliver explainable automation and intelligent analyst assistance.

## Current Foundations
The platform already provides several building blocks that make AI-assisted features feasible:
- **Metadata-first configuration studio** for definitions, ingestion adapters, schema mapping, and access control, reducing the need for hardcoded logic and enabling AI to reason over structured reconciliation definitions.【F:docs/wiki/features.md†L17-L78】【F:docs/wiki/Admin-Configurator-Guide.md†L1-L55】
- **Spring Boot services** orchestrating matching runs, workflow state, exports, and system activity, exposing clean REST APIs for extension.【F:docs/wiki/Architecture.md†L4-L118】
- **Angular SPA with shared state services** for analysts and checkers, providing clear integration points for conversational experiences and AI-driven insights.【F:frontend/src/app/services/reconciliation-state.service.ts†L1-L160】
- **Run analytics calculator** and activity feeds that already summarize outcomes and track user actions, supplying structured signals to train AI or drive prompts.【F:backend/src/main/java/com/universal/reconciliation/service/RunAnalyticsCalculator.java†L1-L104】

## AI Integration Opportunities
### 1. Analyst Copilot & Conversational Insights
- **Run narrative summaries:** Use an LLM prompt pipeline that ingests the latest run analytics, break distributions, and recent activity events to generate a short, auditable synopsis surfaced alongside dashboards. Store the generated narrative with correlation IDs in the activity log for compliance.
- **Natural language Q&A:** Embed a chat panel in the analyst workspace that lets users query reconciliations in natural language (e.g., "Why did cash vs GL mismatches spike yesterday?"). Back the assistant with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that pulls structured metrics, break details, and configuration metadata before composing an answer.
- **Proactive recommendations:** When analysts perform bulk updates or comment on breaks, trigger an LLM to suggest next-best actions, similar break clusters, or escalation paths. Couple suggestions with maker/checker audit metadata so the AI never auto-acts without human review.

### 2. Workflow Acceleration & Smart Triage
- **Break clustering & prioritization:** Train a lightweight ML model to cluster breaks by root-cause signals (fields involved, historical resolutions, comment keywords). Feed cluster summaries into the LLM so the UI can highlight "Likely FX rate issue" or "Repeat trade booking variance" tags in the break grid.
- **Auto-draft responses:** When checkers review approvals, pre-fill comment drafts that summarize maker context, past resolution steps, and policy reminders. Require explicit confirmation before posting to preserve accountability.
- **Escalation detection:** Monitor activity events for stalled approvals or repeated rejections. Prompt an AI assistant to notify supervisors with context-aware summaries and recommended remediation steps.

### 3. Configuration Studio Intelligence
- **Schema mapping assistant:** During the admin wizard, leverage an LLM fine-tuned on historical definitions to recommend canonical fields, key designations, and tolerance thresholds for newly ingested sources. Provide confidence scores and rationale to keep the human in control.
- **Validation reasoning:** Extend backend validation responses with explanatory text generated by an LLM, helping admins understand why a schedule, access control entry, or ingestion adapter failed validation.
- **Change impact analysis:** Before publishing a configuration update, summarize downstream impacts (affected reports, workflows, and notification targets) by prompting an LLM with metadata diffs and known dependencies.

### 4. Knowledge Management & Onboarding
- **Contextual knowledge base:** Index documentation, ADRs, and onboarding guides in a vector store. Offer an in-app assistant that answers "How do I configure a JDBC adapter?" by citing authoritative wiki passages with links to `docs/wiki` content.
- **Interactive tutorials:** Combine scripted UI walkthroughs with an LLM narrator that adapts explanations based on user questions, accelerating training for new makers/checkers.
- **Policy alignment:** Let compliance teams upload policy PDFs; run embeddings to detect when break comments or exports reference restricted terms and prompt users with corrective guidance.

## Reference Architecture
1. **Data collection:** Stream run analytics, break metadata, comments, and activity events into a feature store. Mirror sanitized copies into a secure AI workspace to respect data residency.
2. **Model layer:**
   - Use domain-specific embedding models (e.g., finance-tuned MiniLM) for semantic search across breaks and documentation.
   - Host foundation LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o, Azure OpenAI, or local Llama 3) behind an orchestration service that enforces prompt templates and redaction policies.
   - Train auxiliary ML models for clustering/anomaly scoring to reduce LLM token usage.
3. **Orchestration service:** Implement a Spring Boot microservice or module (`ai-assistant-service`) responsible for:
   - Retrieval pipelines (vector search, SQL queries) and prompt assembly.
   - Guardrails (PII masking, response moderation, token quotas per user/role).
   - Maker/checker enforcement so every AI-generated action is saved as a draft that requires explicit human confirmation before execution.
   - Audit logging that writes every prompt/response pair into `system_activity_log` for review.
4. **Frontend integration:** Build Angular services/components that call the AI orchestration endpoints, render conversational UIs, and display AI suggestions with explanations and feedback buttons.
5. **Feedback loop:** Capture user ratings on AI responses, feed them into retraining pipelines, and expose analytics dashboards for AI usage and effectiveness.

### Provider Abstraction & Pluggability
- Introduce a provider-neutral interface inside the orchestration service (e.g., `LLMClient` with adapters for OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and self-hosted OSS models such as Llama 3 or Mistral). Configuration determines the active provider at runtime, enabling quick failover or cost optimization.
- Use environment-specific configuration (`application-ai.yml`) and secret stores (Vault/Azure Key Vault) to inject API keys or endpoint URLs. This keeps OpenAI integration first-class while allowing like-for-like replacements without code changes.
- Define provider capability metadata (context window, function calling support, streaming ability) so prompt pipelines can gracefully degrade if an alternative model lacks a feature.

## Delivery Considerations
- **Security & Compliance:** Enforce role-based prompts, redact sensitive data before it leaves the secure boundary, and ensure AI outputs are immutable audit events. Use maker/checker principles for AI-assisted actions.
- **Performance:** Cache frequently requested insights, batch retrieval queries, and cap token counts to keep response times within analyst expectations (sub-2 seconds for summaries, sub-5 seconds for conversational answers).
- **Explainability:** Accompany every AI recommendation with structured evidence links (e.g., break IDs, report names) so users can verify outcomes easily.
- **Change Management:** Pilot AI features with opt-in cohorts, measure effectiveness against manual baselines, and iterate on prompts/models based on quantitative feedback.
- **Human-in-the-loop Guarantees:** Treat all AI outputs as drafts; require explicit analyst or checker confirmation before any workflow, configuration, or data change is applied, regardless of the LLM provider in use.

## Phased Roadmap & Delivery Epics
The roadmap below groups work into phases aligned to quarter-sized increments. Each phase contains epics that can be decomposed into stories during sprint planning.

### Phase 0 – Foundation Readiness (Weeks 0-4)
- **Epic: AI Governance Baseline** – Document usage policies, redaction rules, and manual-confirmation guidelines. Implement audit schema extensions and update maker/checker SOPs so AI-generated suggestions remain drafts until a human approves them.
- **Epic: Data & Telemetry Plumbing** – Stand up the secure AI workspace, enable event streaming into feature stores, and add opt-in telemetry for AI interactions.
- **Epic: Provider Abstraction MVP** – Build the `LLMClient` interface, implement the OpenAI adapter using the GPT-4o API, and scaffold an alternative adapter targeting an on-prem Llama endpoint to prove pluggability.

### Phase 1 – Analyst Experience Pilot (Weeks 5-10)
- **Epic: Run Narrative Summaries** – Deliver daily/adhoc summaries using OpenAI via the orchestration service, persisting drafts that require analyst publish confirmation.
- **Epic: Documentation Q&A Copilot** – Launch the RAG-powered assistant sourced from the wiki, ensuring every answer cites evidence and offers a "Use Recommendation" confirmation button rather than auto-applying decisions.
- **Epic: Feedback & Guardrails Telemetry** – Capture user ratings, manual overrides, and decision confirmations to feed model evaluation dashboards.

### Phase 2 – Workflow Intelligence Expansion (Weeks 11-18)
- **Epic: Break Clustering & Triage** – Train clustering models, surface AI-prioritized queues, and keep recommended actions as editable drafts awaiting checker approval.
- **Epic: Auto-Drafted Comments & Escalations** – Pre-fill response templates from OpenAI (or fallback models) with compliance footers; require explicit user confirmation before posting.
- **Epic: Schema Mapping Assistant** – Embed the LLM in the configuration studio with provider fallback logic and rationale logging.

### Phase 3 – Enterprise Hardening & Optionality (Weeks 19-26)
- **Epic: Multi-Provider Orchestration** – Productionize additional adapters (Azure OpenAI, self-hosted Llama/Mistral) with health checks, routing policies, and run-time selection per workspace/tenant.
- **Epic: Monitoring & Quality Ops** – Build Grafana dashboards for latency, cost, and confirmation rates. Add automated prompt regression tests and drift detection workflows.
- **Epic: Data Residency & On-Prem Enablement** – Extend sanitization pipelines, deploy vector stores within regional boundaries, and validate that alternative models respect the same guardrails.

### Ongoing – Continuous Improvement
- Rotate model versions behind feature flags, run quarterly prompt/guardrail reviews, and expand knowledge indexing as documentation grows.
- Maintain a "human-in-the-loop" checklist for every new feature to ensure AI never auto-executes configuration or workflow changes without user confirmation.

## Next Steps
- Validate data governance requirements with compliance and security stakeholders.
- Prioritize pilot use cases with the operations and analyst leads to ensure measurable ROI.
- Prototype prompt templates using historical run exports and anonymized activity logs before committing to production integration.
