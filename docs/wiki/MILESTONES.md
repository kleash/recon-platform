# Development Milestones & Lessons Learned

This timeline captures the major phases that shaped the Universal Reconciliation Platform. Each milestone highlights the features delivered, supporting artifacts within this repository, and key lessons that continue to influence engineering practices.

## Phase 0 – Charter & Bootstrap (Month 0)
- **Highlights:** Drafted the product charter, captured scope in `docs/Bootstrap.md`, and defined the metadata-first philosophy for reconciliation onboarding.
- **Key Assets:** Infrastructure scaffolding under `infra/`, historical context in `docs/Bootstrap.md`.
- **Lessons Learned:** Align early on configuration-driven principles to avoid brittle feature flags later. Establish documentation expectations from day one to keep wiki artifacts authoritative.

## Phase 1 – Foundational Monolith (Months 1-2)
- **Highlights:**
  - Established the Spring Boot monolith entry point (`UniversalReconciliationPlatformApplication`) with async support.
  - Created baseline domain entities and repositories covering reconciliations, runs, breaks, approvals, and exports (`backend/src/main/java/com/universal/reconciliation/domain`).
  - Implemented authentication/authorization via LDAP-integrated `security` module and JWT propagation (`backend/src/main/java/com/universal/reconciliation/security`).
- **Key Assets:** Backend `pom.xml`, `ReconciliationController`, `AuthController`, initial unit tests.
- **Lessons Learned:** Modeling maker/checker roles in entities early simplified later workflow features; securing controllers with `UserContext` reduced retrofitting costs.

## Phase 2 – Matching Engine & Ingestion (Months 3-4)
- **Highlights:**
  - Delivered the metadata-driven matching engine (`service/matching`) that produces `MatchingResult` artifacts used by `ReconciliationService`.
  - Added ingestion adapters (`service/ingestion`) and the standalone ingestion SDK (`libraries/ingestion-sdk`) to normalize CSVs and AI-enriched documents.
  - Wired in ETL blueprints under `backend/src/main/java/com/universal/reconciliation/etl` and example payloads in `examples/common`.
- **Key Assets:** `SourceIngestionService`, `CsvIngestionAdapter`, ingestion CLI scripts, integration harness.
- **Lessons Learned:** Adapters with a uniform `IngestionAdapterRequest` contract accelerated onboarding of new sources. Keeping ingestion logic in a shared SDK prevented drift between CLI and backend behaviors.

## Phase 3 – Analyst Workspace Experience (Months 5-6)
- **Highlights:**
  - Built the Angular analyst workspace with standalone components for reconciliation list, run detail, result grid, break drawer, and system activity (`frontend/src/app/components`).
  - Created reactive state services (`ReconciliationStateService`, `ResultGridStateService`) to orchestrate API calls and UI synchronization.
  - Implemented break search pagination and selection APIs (`BreakSearchService`, `BreakSelectionService`).
- **Key Assets:** Angular routes, Material-based UI components, TypeScript models mirroring backend DTOs.
- **Lessons Learned:** Co-locating API bindings and state logic in services improved testability; providing cursor-based pagination from day one avoided grid rework.

## Phase 4 – Workflow Automation & Exports (Months 7-8)
- **Highlights:**
  - Introduced approval queue APIs (`ReconciliationService.fetchApprovalQueue`) and checker dashboard components.
  - Added export job orchestration (`ExportJobService`, `/api/exports`) delivering Excel files, plus Playwright coverage to validate downloads.
  - Expanded system activity stream capturing run triggers, approvals, and configuration changes (`SystemActivityService`).
- **Key Assets:** `components/checker-queue`, `components/system-activity`, backend export services, Playwright smoke tests.
- **Lessons Learned:** Recording structured system events simplified audit requirements; asynchronous exports keep API latencies predictable under high volume.

## Phase 5 – Admin Console & Metadata Governance (Months 9-10)
- **Highlights:**
  - Delivered admin-facing Angular workflows for maintaining definitions, transformations, and access control (`components/admin`, `AdminReconciliationStateService`).
  - Hardened repositories and services to enforce maker/checker governance across configuration changes (`service/admin/*`).
  - Embedded ingestion SDK guidance directly into the wiki (`docs/wiki/ingestion-sdk.md`).
- **Key Assets:** Admin controllers, shared DTOs, onboarding tutorial.
- **Lessons Learned:** Drafting metadata changes on the client before publishing prevents partial updates; validating LDAP groups up front reduces runtime support incidents.

## Phase 6 – Observability & Historical Scale (Months 11-12)
- **Highlights:**
  - Added historical seed scripts (`scripts/seed-historical.sh`, `scripts/verify-historical-seed.sh`) to simulate large volumes and verify run analytics.
  - Extended automation harness to launch full stack and execute Playwright flows (`automation/regression/scripts/prepare.mjs`).
  - Streamlined documentation navigator and database schema diagrams in the wiki for operational readiness.
- **Key Assets:** Automation reports under `automation/regression/reports`, wiki navigator, database diagrams.
- **Lessons Learned:** Automating heavy data seeds catches performance regressions early; bundling documentation with tooling reduces tribal knowledge risk.

## Phase 7 – AI-Assisted Operations (Ongoing)
- **Highlights:**
  - Integrated AI services for document ingestion and break explanation hints (`service/ai`).
  - Prepared harness debug controller (`controller/harness/HarnessDebugController`) to assist with sandboxing GPT-based flows.
  - Documented AI usage considerations in the onboarding guide.
- **Key Assets:** `OpenAiDocumentIngestionAdapter`, AI service classes, harness debugging endpoints.
- **Lessons Learned:** Keep AI interactions behind adapters for easy swapping; capture explainability metadata to satisfy audit teams.

## Continuing Investments
- **Documentation:** Every release updates the wiki knowledge base (including this milestone record) to keep product, engineering, and operations aligned.
- **Testing:** CI gates run backend, frontend, automation, and seed scripts to ensure parity across touchpoints.
- **Governance:** Decisions are logged in `docs/wiki/DECISIONS.md`, and architectural updates cascade through `ARCHITECTURE.md` and database diagrams.

Use this chronology to understand how the platform evolved and which artifacts to reference when extending its capabilities.
