  - Simplified canonical schema maintenance by removing redundant transformation controls from the legacy schema step.
- **Global multi-asset showcase (2025-10-04)**
  - Added the Excel ingestion adapter and corresponding automation fixtures to reconcile six heterogeneous sources.
  - Authored the Global Multi-Asset playbook with diagrams covering business flow, technical hotspots, and usage.
