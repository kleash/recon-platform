- **Canonical field lifecycle audit (2025-10-07)**
  - Retired the unused `transformationExpression` column across backend APIs, frontend models, and seed payloads in favour of structured transformation chains.
  - Updated architecture, component, and API references to describe the end-to-end canonical field pipeline (transformation plan → field transformations → persistence).
  - Added troubleshooting guidance for clients still posting the deprecated field so rollout teams can resolve `UnrecognizedPropertyException` errors quickly.
- **Readability and observability uplift (2025-10-06)**
  - Documented the reconciliation workspace orchestration and state services so new contributors can follow the tab/filter lifecycle without reverse-engineering the templates.
  - Added structured logging in `ReconciliationService`, `BreakService`, and the dynamic matching engine to make correlation IDs, match counts, and bulk workflow operations visible in production logs.
  - Updated run-book guidance to highlight the new log streams and recommended verification flow when reconciling maker/checker actions.
- **Source schema refactor (2025-10-03)**
  - Reordered the admin configurator wizard so raw source schema capture precedes transformations and matching.
  - Persisted per-source schema metadata and introduced automated inference from sample files.
  - Simplified canonical schema maintenance by removing redundant transformation controls from the legacy schema step.
- **Global multi-asset showcase (2025-10-04)**
  - Added the Excel ingestion adapter and corresponding automation fixtures to reconcile six heterogeneous sources.
  - Authored the Global Multi-Asset playbook with diagrams covering business flow, technical hotspots, and usage.
  - Updated the integration harness and ingestion SDK so Excel, CSV, and pipe-delimited feeds can be rehearsed in CI.
- **Transformation plan enrichment (2025-10-05)**
  - Expanded `GLOBAL_MULTI_ASSET_HISTORY` and the harness mirror to include dataset Groovy scripts, row filters, and
    column pipelines for every source feed.
  - Added regression coverage that validates each payload exports the full transformation contract so future edits do
    not strip the examples by accident.
  - Documented the new normalization patterns in COMPONENTS, PATTERNS, and TROUBLESHOOTING to guide feature teams.
- **Angular 20 platform upgrade (2025-10-04)**
  - Stepped the frontend through Angular 18 → 19 → 20 with TypeScript 5.8.2 and Node 20.19.5.
  - Accepted CLI migrations for bundler module resolution and standalone-by-default components, trimming unused pipes to quell new compiler warnings.
  - Executed the full quality gate suite (backend unit tests, Karma, Playwright, integration harness, bootstrap, historical seed) to confirm parity post-upgrade.
