# Phase 2 Business Overview

## Objective
Deliver configurable reconciliation controls that scale beyond the pilot use case by introducing flexible matching logic, granular maker/checker governance, operational analytics, and analyst productivity tooling.

## Delivered Value Streams

### 1. Configurable Matching & Data Quality
* **Metadata-driven comparison logic** – Operations can define key, compare, product, sub-product, and entity fields with per-field data types and tolerances, allowing a single engine to support heterogeneous reconciliations without code changes.
* **Tolerant exception detection** – Numeric thresholds, case-insensitive checks, and date-only comparisons reduce false positives while guaranteeing consistent break attribution across products and entities.
* **Dimensional break attribution** – Breaks are tagged with product, sub-product, and entity metadata, unlocking targeted ownership and downstream reporting.

### 2. Governance & Controls
* **Maker/checker workflow enforcement** – Access control entries now capture dimensional scope and maker/checker roles, restricting who can view, comment on, or close a break.
* **Scoped break permissions** – Runtime checks evaluate a user’s LDAP groups against product/entity scopes to decide which breaks can be acted upon and which status transitions are permissible.
* **Audit-grade activity feed** – All reconciliation runs, status transitions, and comments are persisted as system events, giving risk teams near-real-time visibility.

### 3. Operational Intelligence
* **System activity timeline** – A new dashboard stream exposes the twenty most recent system events so supervisors can monitor throughput and control breaches at a glance.
* **Filterable break inventory** – Analysts can slice the break list by product, sub-product, entity, and status, dramatically reducing investigation time for targeted queues.
* **Run metadata capture** – Additional run-level metrics and break payload storage enable richer MI reporting and future SLA dashboards.

### 4. Analyst Productivity
* **Inline workflow actions** – Maker/checker buttons and comment forms sit alongside break details, ensuring actions occur in-context with full history visibility.
* **Persistent UI state** – Frontend state services synchronise selected reconciliations, filters, and breaks so analysts avoid redundant clicks while working large inventories.
* **Seamless exports** – Analysts can continue exporting the latest run with one click, even as filters and workflows evolve.

## Out-of-Scope (Deferred to Later Phases)
* Automated ingestion from upstream data lakes or message buses.
* SLA dashboards, alerting, and exception ownership routing.
* Externalised configuration management for reconciliation metadata.
* Bulk break actions and cross-run trend analytics.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. **Channel real-time ingestion** – Add streaming and scheduled triggers so reconciliations execute without manual intervention.
2. **Enrich audit review** – Provide dedicated audit reports, search, and retention tooling built on the activity log foundation.
3. **Industrialise deployment** – Harden CI/CD, containerise both tiers, and integrate quality gates to maintain >70% automated coverage.
4. **Extend analytics** – Layer visual dashboards for reconciliation health, throughput, and control adherence using the captured dimensions.
