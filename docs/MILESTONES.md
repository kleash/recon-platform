- **Source schema refactor (2025-10-03)**
  - Reordered the admin configurator wizard so raw source schema capture precedes transformations and matching.
  - Persisted per-source schema metadata and introduced automated inference from sample files.
  - Simplified canonical schema maintenance by removing redundant transformation controls from the legacy schema step.
- **Global multi-asset showcase (2025-10-04)**
  - Added the Excel ingestion adapter and corresponding automation fixtures to reconcile six heterogeneous sources.
  - Authored the Global Multi-Asset playbook with diagrams covering business flow, technical hotspots, and usage.
  - Updated the integration harness and ingestion SDK so Excel, CSV, and pipe-delimited feeds can be rehearsed in CI.
- **Spring Boot 3.5.6 upgrade (2025-10-04)**
  - Raised the backend parent BOM from Spring Boot 3.2.5 to 3.5.6 and verified the service on Java 17.
  - Re-ran backend unit tests, Playwright automation, integration harness, bootstrap, and historical seeding to confirm parity.
  - Documented the procedure in `docs/wiki/spring-boot-upgrade-3-5-6-checklist.md` for future backend refreshes.
