# Phase 3 Business Release Overview

## Executive Summary
Phase 3 elevates the Universal Reconciliation Platform from a configurable MVP to a mature analyst workstation. Users now enjoy richer analytics, faster workflow execution through bulk actions, and an export engine aligned with audit and reporting expectations. The release also formalises API-triggered executions so that reconciliations can be orchestrated by external systems while preserving maker/checker governance.

## Key Capabilities

### Configurable Reporting Engine
* Every reconciliation can own a tailored Excel template. Business administrators define column order, friendly headers, and whether mismatched fields should be highlighted.
* Reports include distinct tabs for matched records, mismatches, and missing records. The matched tab summarises reconciliation coverage for quick attestation, while the exception tabs apply template-driven layouts.
* Export actions are audit-tracked and the generated workbooks embed trigger metadata (trigger type, initiator, correlation id, comments) to satisfy downstream controls teams.

### Bulk Workflow Productivity
* Analysts can select multiple breaks and apply status transitions and commentary in a single action. The service enforces maker/checker rules on every selected break and records a dedicated audit event summarising the bulk update.
* The UI surfaces the number of selected breaks, available common status transitions, and a streamlined form for bulk comments and action codes.

### Advanced Dashboard & Analytics
* The run detail panel now displays trigger context, visible break totals, status distribution, product concentration, and open-break aging buckets. Analysts immediately understand portfolio risk without leaving the page.
* Break drill downs render field-by-field comparisons with differences highlighted, accelerating root-cause analysis.

### API-Based Triggering Enhancements
* Trigger requests capture trigger type, correlation id, comments, and initiator information. Runs store these attributes, expose them via the API, and display them in the UI and Excel exports.
* Supported trigger types now include manual API, scheduled CRON, external API calls, and Kafka events, enabling orchestration from enterprise schedulers or streaming pipelines.

## Operational Considerations
* Bulk updates and report exports emit system activity log entries, providing support teams a consolidated view of high-impact actions.
* The reporting engine reads configuration from the database, allowing future template changes without redeploying the service.
* Trigger metadata surfaces in every downstream artifact (API payloads, dashboard, exports) so that audit reviews can reconstruct decision trails quickly.

## Release Readiness Checklist
* ✅ Integration test coverage exceeds the mandated 70% threshold via Jacoco enforcement.
* ✅ Regression suites (`mvn test`, `npm test`) run cleanly.
* ✅ Documentation updated for business stakeholders, developers, operations, and line-by-line technical guides.
