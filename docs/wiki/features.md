## Capability Matrix
| Domain | Feature | Description | Key Consumers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Configuration | Metadata-driven reconciliations | Define entities, matching keys, tolerances, and workflow roles without code changes. | Reconciliation administrators |
| Configuration | Pluggable data ingestion | Accept staged data from ETL pipelines, flat files, or upstream systems through standardized staging tables. | Data engineering |
| Matching | Multi-stage matching rules | Support exact, tolerance-based, and custom comparison logic with prioritised rule stacks. | Matching engine |
| Matching | Run orchestration | Trigger runs manually, on schedules, via API calls, or from Kafka topics. | Operations teams |
| Workflow | Automated break creation | Classify mismatches into actionable break records with contextual metadata. | Makers |
| Workflow | Maker-checker lifecycle | Enforce configurable approval flows with comments, attachments, and status transitions. | Makers, checkers |
| Workflow | Bulk updates | Perform mass status updates and annotations directly from filtered break lists. | Makers |
| Analytics | Real-time dashboards | Surface run-level KPIs, distribution charts, and trend lines for each reconciliation. | Analysts, leadership |
| Analytics | Activity feeds | Chronicle runs, approvals, exports, and user actions for audit review. | Risk & audit |
| Reporting | On-demand exports | Generate Excel exports based on configurable templates and deliver via UI or API. | Analysts |
| Reporting | Scheduled distribution | Automate recurring report delivery with templated emails, SFTP drops, or API callbacks. | Operations |
| Security | LDAP-authenticated access | Integrate with enterprise LDAP for authentication and authorization scopes. | Platform users |
| Security | Scope-based entitlements | Restrict recon visibility by product, entity, or geography tied to LDAP groups. | Security admins |
| Observability | System activity logging | Capture structured events for runs, workflow actions, and configuration changes. | Support teams |
| Observability | Metrics & health endpoints | Provide actuator endpoints and dashboards for infrastructure monitoring. | SRE teams |

## Feature Deep Dive

### 1. Configuration Studio
- **Dynamic schema builder:** register reconciliation definitions, field metadata, and rule hierarchies through configuration forms or API payloads.
- **Reusable templates:** clone baseline configurations (e.g., cash vs GL, securities positions) to accelerate onboarding.
- **Environment promotion:** export/import configuration packages between environments ensuring parity without manual edits.

### 2. Matching & Analytics Engine
- **Rule execution pipeline:** executes staged data through deterministic matching passes with tolerance-aware comparators.
- **Outcome persistence:** writes run summaries, analytics aggregates, and break snapshots for downstream review.
- **Performance safeguards:** parallelizes matching jobs, enforces batch sizing, and exposes metrics for throughput tuning.

### 3. Workflow & Case Management
- **Maker toolset:** annotate breaks, attach documents, request approvals, and perform targeted bulk updates.
- **Checker console:** review pending approvals with full context, approve/reject actions, and capture regulatory commentary.
- **Audit immutability:** every transition, comment, and attachment is recorded with LDAP principal metadata for traceability.

### 4. Analyst Experience
- **Responsive dashboards:** present run KPIs, filterable break grids, and drill-down side-by-side source comparisons.
- **Stateful sessions:** preserve analyst context, filters, and selections across navigation or page refreshes.
- **Assisted investigation:** highlight mismatched fields, surface data lineage, and embed reference data for faster resolution.

### 5. Reporting & Distribution
- **Excel template designer:** configure tab layouts, column ordering, formatting, and formulas using metadata stored in the database.
- **Delivery options:** download instantly from the UI, invoke via API, or schedule recurring deliveries with optional distribution lists.
- **Compliance-ready archives:** persist generated reports with metadata for audit retrieval and retention policies.

### 6. Integration Surface
- **REST API:** orchestrate reconciliations, manage configurations, and query outcomes programmatically.
- **Event-driven hooks:** listen to Kafka topics for automated triggers or push notifications on run completion.
- **External orchestrators:** support invocation from enterprise schedulers, RPA bots, or workflow engines via secure APIs.

### 7. Security & Compliance
- **Unified identity:** rely on LDAP groups for access scopes, maker/checker roles, and reporting permissions.
- **Configurable data masking:** protect sensitive attributes in UI views and exports based on role-specific policies.
- **End-to-end audit:** unify log streams, activity feeds, and database history for regulatory examinations.

### 8. Operations & Support
- **Health monitoring:** integrate Spring Actuator endpoints with observability platforms for uptime and performance tracking.
- **Self-healing ETL:** detect missing demo data or configuration drift and reseed baseline reconciliations on startup.
- **Run diagnostics:** provide correlation IDs, execution timelines, and anomaly detection flags for support engineers.
