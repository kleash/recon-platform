# AI Contributor Guide

Welcome, automated contributor! Follow these ground rules to collaborate effectively on the Universal Reconciliation Platform repository.

## Core Operating Principles

Before you start any task, internalize these directivesâ€”they govern all work in this repository:

1. **Work doggedly.** Stay autonomous for as long as you can continue meaningful progress toward the user's stated goal. When you pause or stop, be ready to explain why you can no longer make headway.
2. **Work smart.** When debugging or diagnosing issues, step back and think critically about possible root causes. Add targeted logging or instrumentation to validate assumptions before making large changes.
3. **Check your work.** Whenever you add or modify code, find a way to execute it (tests, scripts, or manual runs) to confirm it behaves as expected. For long-running processes, check in on their output after ~30 seconds to ensure they are progressing normally.
4. **Be cautious with terminal commands.** Evaluate every command before running it to confirm it will terminate on its own. Launch non-terminating commands (like servers) in separate processes and make sure any helper scripts are safe to run unattended.

## Repository Orientation
- **Backend:** `backend/` holds the Spring Boot services, matching engine, workflow logic, and ETL pipelines.
- **Frontend:** `frontend/` contains the Angular 17 single-page application with standalone components and a shared state service.
- **Documentation:** Centralized under `docs/wiki`. Start with `docs/wiki/README.md` for navigation, then update specialized guides as needed.
- **Data Model:** The database schema is critical. Refer to `docs/wiki/Architecture.md` for diagrams.
- **Historical context:** `docs/Bootstrap.md` stores the original charter and phased rollout plan.

## Contribution Checklist
1. **Plan before you code.** Review related wiki pages to ensure solutions align with platform patterns.
2. **Keep documentation in sync.** Any code change that affects features, workflows, or onboarding must update the relevant pages in `docs/wiki` and new changes for any features or refactor should keep documenting in following markdown documentation:
   * **COMPONENTS.md** Component catalog with usage examples
   * **MILESTONES.md** Development history and lessons learned
   * **DECISIONS.md** Technical choices and their rationale
   * **PATTERNS.md** Reusable code patterns and conventions
   * **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** Common issues and solutions

3. **Prefer incremental commits.** Group logically-related changes and provide descriptive commit messages.
4. **Respect configuration over code.** Extend metadata-driven constructs instead of hardcoding reconciliation behavior.
5. **Keep test cases up to date.** Any code change that affects features, workflows, or onboarding must update the relevant test cases in backend, frontend, automation smoke, example integration harness, and bootstrap scripts.

## Quality Gates
- **Backend tests:** `cd backend && ./mvnw test`
- **Frontend tests:** `cd frontend && npm test -- --watch=false --browsers=ChromeHeadless`
- **Automation smoke (Playwright):** `cd automation/regression && npm install && npm test`
- **Examples integration harness:** `examples/integration-harness/scripts/run_multi_example_e2e.sh`
- **Bootstrap scripts:** `./scripts/local-dev.sh bootstrap` (and `seed` once the stack is running) to confirm local helpers stay healthy.
- **Historical volume seed:** `./scripts/seed-historical.sh --days 3 --runs-per-day 1 --report-format NONE --ci-mode` followed by `./scripts/verify-historical-seed.sh --days 3 --runs-per-day 1 --skip-export-check` to mirror the lightweight CI cadence and ensure large-scale data workflows continue to pass.
- Include command outputs in pull request descriptions when applicable.

## Automation & E2E Toolkit
- **Playwright harness:** `automation/regression/` bundles the cross-stack smoke suite. The `npm test` command triggers `scripts/prepare.mjs` to build the backend, install/frontend, download browsers, and launch both services before running Playwright.
- **Headed/debug runs:** Use `npm run test:headed` in the same directory to observe interactions and surface Playwright's debug console when triaging failures.
- **Evidence capture:** Review `automation/regression/playwright-report/` for the interactive HTML report and `automation/regression/reports/latest/` for Markdown/JSON artifacts when attaching run evidence.
- **Extending coverage:** Add scenarios under `automation/regression/tests/` and refresh fixtures in `automation/regression/tests/fixtures/` to keep parity with new reconciliation features.

## Examples Validation
- **Multi-scenario smoke:** Run `examples/integration-harness/scripts/run_multi_example_e2e.sh` to provision all example reconciliations, drive ingestion via the bundled CLI, and assert reconciliation summaries.
- **Port considerations:** Override `APP_PORT` when your local stack already occupies `8080` (e.g., `APP_PORT=9090 examples/integration-harness/scripts/run_multi_example_e2e.sh`).
- **Troubleshooting artifacts:** Inspect the temporary log path printed by the harness when diagnosing build or runtime issues; the script cleans it up automatically after a successful run.

## Bootstrap & Seed Scripts
- **Dependency bootstrap:** Use `./scripts/local-dev.sh bootstrap` to exercise the dependency setup flow (backend Maven cache + frontend npm install). Failures signal drift in required toolchain versions.
- **Seed data freshness:** After the platform is running (local stack or integration harness), run `./scripts/local-dev.sh seed` to reapply reconciliation payloads and ingest fixtures. Keep `examples/integration-harness/payloads/*.json` and fixture CSVs current whenever metadata changes so seeded data matches production expectations.
- **CLI health:** The seed command builds the ingestion CLI under `examples/integration-harness/target/`; rerun it when modifying ingestion flows to ensure packaging still succeeds.

## Documentation Standards
- Write in Markdown with clear headings and use Mermaid diagrams for complex flows when possible.
- Link to related wiki sections using relative paths (`[Developer Guide](docs/wiki/developer-guide.md)`).
- Keep README concise and defer deep dives to the wiki.

## Decision Records
If you introduce significant architectural or process changes, capture the rationale in a new page under `docs/wiki/adr-<topic>.md` and link it from the wiki home.

## Working With Gemini Code Assist Reviews

When you open a pull request that introduces a new feature, follow this loop to collaborate smoothly with Gemini Code Assist:

1. **Upload full context in the PR description.** Summarise the feature request, your approach, and any key implementation notes.
2. **Wait for review feedback.** Poll the PR for comments from `@gemini-code-assist` every 5 minutes (maximum three checks or 15 minutes total). Stop early if Gemini has already posted feedback.
3. **Apply fixes.** For each Gemini comment:
   - Update the code or docs as requested.
   - Re-run the required quality gates (`backend`/`frontend` tests, automation, seed scripts, etc.).
4. **Push an incremental commit** to the same PR and respond to Gemini in the relevant thread (tag `@gemini-code-assist`).
5. **Repeat** the loop (back to step 2) until Gemini has no further comments.

Once all feedback is addressed and quality gates are green, the PR is ready for human review.

Thank you for helping us build a resilient reconciliation platform!
